### Slack Account

All of our communication throughout the hackweek will be done using the
{{ '[`{hackweek}` Slack workspace]({url})'.format(hackweek=hackweek, url=slack_workspace_url)}}.

email to join the Slack workspace. Upon accepting the invite, please take a moment to

to identify you on Slack and builds a more personal community throughout
the week.
