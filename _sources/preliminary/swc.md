# Software Carpentry Training

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) is a fantastic
organization that teaches basic lab skills for research computing.

For past hackweeks we have offered unofficial, abbreviated 2-day software
carpentry trainings to help everyone gain skills in fundamental data science
tools (Git, Linux Terminal, Python). By offering this work in advance of the
hackweek we can maximize the amount of time we get to focus on more advanced
topics.

Below you will find links to our training materials from the 2021 SnowEx
Hackweek. If you are new to Git, Linux, Python, please set aside a day or two
to go over these materials in advance:

## Getting ready

Please take a minute before the workshop to go over
the [GitHub instructions](github), create an account.

```{attention}
We will be using the JupyterHub ({{ jupyterhub_url }}) throughout this workshop.
We encourage you to test your [connection to JupyterHub](jupyterhub) before the training.
```
