# Project Team Name

## Bryony Freer 

The following people contributed to our project throughout the week:
* Project lead: Bryony Freer
* Team member: Anna Puggard
* Team member: Maria Lozano 
* Team member: Danielle Grau


## Project Goals

Our team is interested in estimating the length scales of grounding zone depressions and their statistical distribution across the Antarctic continent. 


## Project Outcomes

List and describe, if desired, any project outcomes accomplished during the week.
These may be individual or aggregate, large or small.
The idea is to capture what your team learned and accomplished.
Links to relevant outputs are a great way to capture these outcomes, so long as the links are likely to remain valid for some time (this readme - with this list - will be archived as part of the Hackweek JupyterBook).
Some examples might be:

* We submitted a [Pull Request (PR) to the earthaccess library](https://nsidc.github.io/earthaccess/) to fix a typo.
* Kate opened a [discussion on icepyx](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx/discussions).
* Sam and Harvey put in a [SlideRule feature request](https://github.com/orgs/ICESat2-SlideRule/discussions).
* six team members wrote [functions for Pho](link to project team repository).
* We wrote a code block that finds the highest and lowest photon in a granule.
* [Example Workflow Jupyter Notebook](your notebook url here).
* We drafted a conference abstract for submission to [conference](https://www.agu.org/).


## Future Efforts

Have you built any great new collaborations you anticipate continuing after the Hackweek?
Is your team planning to keep meeting to continue hacking or draft a conference abstract or proposal?
Did you start doing some work that relates to your research and enables you to contribute to shared tools for working with ICESat-2 data products?
Please share your hopes and plans for the future here!
