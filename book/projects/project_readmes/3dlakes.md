# Project Team Name

## Team Members

The following people contributed to our project throughout the week:
* Project lead: [Imran Khan]
* Helper: [Christian Kienholz]
* Team member: [Siddhi Garg]
* Team member: [Vengus Panhwar]
* Team member: [Jonathan Burton]


## Project Goals

Our team wanted gain experience working with tutorial material related to IceSat2, GIT, and collaborative coding environment like Jupyter.
Create and practice some basic python functions and run with data. 
Using and integrating diverse sets of data.

## Project Outcomes

List and describe, if desired, any project outcomes accomplished during the week.
These may be individual or aggregate, large or small.
The idea is to capture what your team learned and accomplished.
Links to relevant outputs are a great way to capture these outcomes, so long as the links are likely to 
remain valid for some time (this readme - with this list - will be archived as part of the Hackweek JupyterBook).
Some examples might be:

* We submitted a Pull Request (PR) to our repository to share data (https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/3DLAKE)
* We each found shapefiles, rasters, and DEMs and pushed data into shared repository (https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/3DLAKE/Data)
* We downloaded .tiff image from Google Earth Engine of our study site
* We pulled surface elevation for a ATL06 (for various dates) for our study site

* We submitted a [Pull Request (PR) to the earthaccess library](https://nsidc.github.io/earthaccess/) to fix a typo.
* Kate opened a [discussion on icepyx](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx/discussions).
* Sam and Harvey put in a [SlideRule feature request](https://github.com/orgs/ICESat2-SlideRule/discussions).
* six team members wrote [functions for Pho](link to project team repository).
* We wrote a code block that finds the highest and lowest photon in a granule.
* [Example Workflow Jupyter Notebook](your notebook url here).
* We drafted a conference abstract for submission to [conference](https://www.agu.org/).


## Future Efforts

Have you built any great new collaborations you anticipate continuing after the Hackweek?
Is your team planning to keep meeting to continue hacking or draft a conference abstract or proposal?
Did you start doing some work that relates to your research and enables you to contribute to shared tools for working with ICESat-2 data products?
Please share your hopes and plans for the future here!
