## Project Goals

What were the goals of your project?
Remember, small, clear, actionable goals are a great way to foster hacking success!
List or state them here.
For example: Our team was interested in further exploring the tutorial material and learning how to collaborate on object oriented code.
Our goal for the week was to design a simple Python class called "Pho" (the ICESat-2 mascot) and have each person contribute a function to describe Pho or let it perform an action based on 


## Project Outcomes

List and describe, if desired, any project outcomes accomplished during the week.
These may be individual or aggregate, large or small.
The idea is to capture what your team learned and accomplished.
Links to relevant outputs are a great way to capture these outcomes, so long as the links are likely to remain valid for some time (this readme - with this list - will be archived as part of the Hackweek JupyterBook).
Some examples might be:

* We submitted a [Pull Request (PR) to the earthaccess library](https://nsidc.github.io/earthaccess/) to fix a typo.
* Kate opened a [discussion on icepyx](https://github.com/icesat2py/icepyx/discussions).
* Sam and Harvey put in a [SlideRule feature request](https://github.com/orgs/ICESat2-SlideRule/discussions).
* six team members wrote [functions for Pho](link to project team repository).
* We wrote a code block that finds the highest and lowest photon in a granule.
* [Example Workflow Jupyter Notebook](your notebook url here).
* We drafted a conference abstract for submission to [conference](https://www.agu.org/).


## Future Efforts

Have you built any great new collaborations you anticipate continuing after the Hackweek?
Is your team planning to keep meeting to continue hacking or draft a conference abstract or proposal?
Did you start doing some work that relates to your research and enables you to contribute to shared tools for working with ICESat-2 data products?
Please share your hopes and plans for the future here!
