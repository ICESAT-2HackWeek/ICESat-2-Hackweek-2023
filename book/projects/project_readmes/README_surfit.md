## Project Goals
Our main goal(s) for this project was to see if we could investigate roughness 

Some individual goals for this project were to
* Get familiar to accessing ICESat-2 data via cloud (e.g., sliderule, earthaccess, etc.). 


### Study Sites 
We compared tracks from Black Rock Desert, Nevada and Utqiagvik, Alaska...


## Project Outcomes

List and describe, if desired, any project outcomes accomplished during the week.
These may be individual or aggregate, large or small.
The idea is to capture what your team learned and accomplished.
Links to relevant outputs are a great way to capture these outcomes, so long as the links are likely to remain valid for some time (this readme - with this list - will be archived as part of the Hackweek JupyterBook).
Some examples might be:

* Ben created visualizations to investiage the question of whether roughness...
* Jessica worked to...
* David....
* 3 team members worked on accessing ATL03 and ATL06 photon data using SlideRule. 
* Nathan wrote code that takes photon clouds and attempts to retrieve the associated surface height distribution. This code assumes the surface height distribution follows a Gaussian or log-normal distribution, convolves this with the ICESat-2 transmit pulse, and attempts to find the distribution parameters (mean height and width or roughness). This version of the code runs over a granule near Utqiagvik.
* 2 team members worked on increasing their familiarity with accessing ICESat-2 data from the cloud
* YoungHyun obtained a geodataframe of the ATL03 data for the region of interest & analyzed how surface roughness varies with different yapc values. 
* [Example Workflow Jupyter Notebook](your notebook url here).



## Future Efforts
David's UCAR submission work?

Have you built any great new collaborations you anticipate continuing after the Hackweek?
Is your team planning to keep meeting to continue hacking or draft a conference abstract or proposal?
Did you start doing some work that relates to your research and enables you to contribute to shared tools for working with ICESat-2 data products?
Please share your hopes and plans for the future here!
