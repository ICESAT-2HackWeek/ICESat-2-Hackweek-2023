### Slack Account

All of our communication throughout the hackweek will be done using the
{{ '[`{hackweek}` Slack workspace]({url})'.format(hackweek=hackweek, url=slack_workspace_url)}}.
With your invite to the hackweek, you should also have received a separate
email to join the Slack workspace. Upon accepting the invite, please take a moment to
[complete your Slack profile](https://slack.com/help/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile).
Having your name and picture with your Slack account helps us and your peers
to identify you on Slack and builds a more personal community throughout
the week.

### EarthData Login

We'll have you download some data from NSIDC for your tutorials and projects.
Visit our [Earthdata](checklist/earthdata.md) page to learn how to access and Earthdata
login account if you don't already have one!

### GitHub Account

Everyone attending {{ hackweek }} will require obtaining a GitHub account.
Visit our [GitHub instruction page](checklist/github.md) to learn how!

### JupyterHub

```{attention}
If this is your first time connecting to the CryoCloud Jupyter Hub, please complete this short [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScb2B5LRy7qU9qDfUp5a51n87sumOxivXbQhc02wFX_FxEbXg/viewform). 

NOTE: the form asks for a NASA Award number. If you are not funded on a NASA award, this is not a problem and you can just type "N/A" or "hackweek".
```
This {{ hackweek }} computing environment is provided by the [CryoCloud project](https://book.cryointhecloud.com/intro.html). Visit our [Introduction to Jupyter Hub](checklist/jupyterhub.md) page to learn more about why we are using Jupyter Hub configurations for hackweeks.

### Git

All content of the hackweek will be shared via GitHub and interacting with the
website will be done via the `git` command.
Visit [Setting up the `git` command](checklist/git.md) to learn how to configure that!
