## Outline

- Discover some interesting ICESat-2 data by browsing [OpenAltimetry](https://openaltimetry.org/data/icesat2/)
- Get the data into a Jupyter Notebook
- Plot the data and overlay the ground track on a map
- Use Google Earth Engine to find the closest-in-time Sentinel-2 image that is cloud-free along ICESat-2's gound track
- Make a plot from ICESat-2 data and contemporaneous imagery in Jupyter/matplotlib
- Bonus material: Extract Sentinel-2 data onto the ICESat-2 ground track
