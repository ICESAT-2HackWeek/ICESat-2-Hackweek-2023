    "Calculating snow depth from ICESat-2 is a little different from other LiDAR snow depth methods as ICESat-2 is a transect of points not gridded raster data and ICESat-2 tracks do not repeat regularly in the mid-latitudes. So we need a independently collected snow-free map of our region of interest for comparison to ICESat-2 and we need to put our snow-free data in a form which it can be differenced from snow-on ICESat-2 data.\n",
