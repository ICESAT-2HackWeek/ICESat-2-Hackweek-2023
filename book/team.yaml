    bio: >
      I spend my days trying to understand how the floating ice shelves surrounding Antarctica are responding to a warming climate:
      How much ice turns into meltwater that pools in lakes at the surface?
      Where does all the meltwater go, and will it damage the ice shelf in the process?
      What does all this mean for the stability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and global sea-level rise?
      To answer these questions, I use a combination of different high-resolution data products from multiple satellite missions.
      Whenever I'm not busy watching Antarctica melt from space through my computer,
      you'll probably find me doing flips at the gymnastics facility or climbing on the face of some mountain.
